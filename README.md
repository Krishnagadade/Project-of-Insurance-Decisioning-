 Perform exploratory data analysis
 Build logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosted decision trees and xgboost models
Evaluate the performance of the models using different set of metrics and prepare a final dataframe containing the train and test metrics for each of the models

some of the guidelines for the project :
Describe in detail each of the experiments 
Include plots and charts
Draw the final conclusion on the basis of comparison of different models.
